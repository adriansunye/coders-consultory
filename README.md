## Reflection

This was a 2 week long project built during my Winter Holidays at FactoriaF5. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with PHP using MVC.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to share their thoughts not only make appointments with an experienced coder. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router`, `material-ui` and finally `axios` for comunicating with the server repository.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Material-UI, Axios and a significant JSX. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup.
